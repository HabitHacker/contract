# HabitHacker

:It is a dapp that helps users create habits. Users can create their own habits by participating in a pool to create specific habits

## user flow

1. Manager creates a habit pool(meta transaction)
2. Users pay a certain amount to join a certain pool
3. The moderator validates the user's actions(meta transaction)
4. Manager runs the settlement function when the pool is finished (meta transaction)

## meaning

Structed data can move off-chain data to on-chain data more or less accurately through nodes such as Oracle and chainlink
It is not easy to validate unstructured data such as exercise and writing to the on-chain.
So we decided to solve this problem by using people's node, similar to nodes in a blockchain network, and we decided to call that person's node a modulator.

## Roadmap

In the future, we will support various chains so that they can use the services in their favorite chains
